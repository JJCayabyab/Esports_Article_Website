        fullDesc: `Aurora ended Smart Omega’s hot streak with a stunning 2-1 victory, wrapping up Week 2 of MPL Philippines Season 14 on Sunday at the Green Sun Hotel in Makati City.\n
        With this win, Aurora improved to 3-1, maintaining solo third place in the standings. Despite the loss, Omega stayed in second place due to a superior net win over Aurora, even though both teams now have identical 3-1 records.\n
        Aurora captain Renejay “Rejenay” Barcase acknowledged Omega’s strong performance, particularly praising rival roamer Joshua “Ch4knu” Mangilog for setting the tone for their opponents.\n
        “Para sakin sobrang ganda po ng laro niya. Wala rin po akong masabi sa laro niya. Siguro Mas naging better lang yung team namin, hindi yung individual players. Lahat naman kami nagperform kanina, pati yung kalaban po namin lahat din sila nagperform. Malinis din talaga laro nila. Sadyang samin talaga pinalad tong laro na to,” shared Renejay.\n
        Jonard “Demonkite” Caranto led the way in the opening game, showcasing his skills with a maniac killing streak on Nolan late in the 16th minute. This performance capped off a 5-1 wipeout, giving Aurora a 1-0 lead.\n
        It seemed a sweep was on the horizon when Demonkite, playing as Ling, secured a triple kill during a 21st-minute skirmish, resulting in a 4-2 exchange in favor of Aurora.\n
        However, Joshua “Ch4knu” Mangilog, playing as Hylos, executed a brilliant defense in the 22nd minute. His play bought enough time for Jomari “Jowm” Pingol, using Claude, to fend off the base turret siege with his own triple kill, leading to a major reversal and tying the series at 1-1.\n

        fullDesc: `The year might have just ended for the competitive VALORANT space, but for many players, plans are already in motion for the future as they gear up for a busy free agency period—including one of the most talented players in the EMEA region.\n
        Fnatic VALORANT star Derke announced today that he’s a restricted free agent, allowing teams to field offers for him ahead of the 2025 season. The 21-year-old phenom has been one of the deadliest players in the world, having won back-to-back stages in Europe this year along with a win at 2023 Masters Tokyo and the 2023 LOCK//IN tournament.\n
        Over the last two years, Derke has helped Fnatic become a dynasty in the EMEA region, causing many fans to call them the kings of Europe due to their extended reign. His ability to create space, land outrageous shots, and start the attack for his squad has placed him firmly into the minds of many analysts alike as a top-10 talent in the world on many occasions.\n
        Next year, however, he could be wearing some different colors on stage, possibly even in another region. The talented superstar said he’d be ready and willing to play for an EMEA team, but he’s also open to swapping to a North American or Pacific organization if the offer is right.\n
        Since he’s a restricted free agent, Fnatic will have a chance to match whatever kind of offer Derke receives. The young star is technically signed with the team until next year, but if another organization poses an offer that Fnatic refuses to match, Derke could be allowed to switch over and sign with that team.\n
        This year, Fnatic didn’t see nearly the same amount of success they did in 2023, even though they won both stages in their home region. Unlike 2023, where they saw a ton of international success, Fnatic failed to qualify for Masters Madrid and dropped out of both Masters Shanghai and VALORANT Champions 2024 in relatively disappointing fashion.\n
        As a result, we might see some sweeping changes to Fnatic that could shift the power within the EMEA region, especially if another player is replaced. Every teammate on this iteration of Fnatic has looked essential, but change may be necessary if the team wishes to adapt and thrive.`

        fullDesc: `
        Valve has taken a stand against Dota 2 teams using the game to advertise their sponsors today, outright banning all sponsor logos during a match such as those seen on team banners, base logos, and player tags.\n
        The move comes just a week before The International begins and is a shock to many organizations who had been using Dota 2‘s in-game elements to advertise their sponsors, with Valve stating the decision was to “remove distracting elements and allow full focus on the game and people playing it” in an Aug. 27 blog post. “Over the years, we’ve built a number of features into Dota to help celebrate these teams and players; unfortunately, we’ve seen those features increasingly being used not to showcase team or player identity, but rather to host advertisements,” the company explained.\n
        Dota fans have become accustomed to seeing sponsors appear in player names through suffixes or team banners for years, with team customization expanded in 2016 after the Battle Cup was added to the TI Compendium. Since then, orgs have sold these elements as product placement to sponsors—but Valve is now pulling the plug.\n
As nice as it is to believe this was done solely to remove these “distracting elements,” some fans believe strict local laws against gambling in Denmark and the EU have forced Valve’s hand. Dota statistician Noxville dove into each TI-qualified team‘s sponsors and while many bookmaking companies appear, there are plenty of other sponsors losing out too.'\n
“Obviously it’d be great if teams didn’t need to advertise like this, but this [is] the reality of the Dota 2 scene: There’s limited income available,” Noxville said on X/Twitter, highlighting that between a record-low prize pool, a lackluster Compendium, and now a sure loss in sponsorship, orgs are struggling to remain afloat in Dota 2.\n
The restriction is only in place during TI 2024 at this time, but given it’s the pinnacle event on the Dota calendar with the most viewers, losing out on even a tag spot will assuredly leave many sponsors fuming—and looking to leave.

        If you’re even a slight fan of League of Legends esports, the name T1 should be familiar to you. The popular Korean organization has won multiple titles over the last decade, including the 2023 World Championship—which is finally being celebrated with the release of the team’s custom Worlds skins.\n
        On Wednesday, Aug. 14, Riot Games finally made the latest T1 skin collection available in League‘s store, with cosmetics for Jayce, Lee Sin, Orianna, Jinx, and Bard dropping for fans around the world. These skins cost about 1,350 RP (roughly $11) each and include a plethora of T1-based graphics, details, and sound effects that are fitting for a four-time Worlds-winning org.\n
        There are, however, a few bundles you can buy if you’re willing to open up your wallet just a bit more. For example, there’s a Signature Edition skin set that includes the five champions, all five T1 2023 Worlds skins in their Signature Edition, five Elite Chromas, six profile icons, and a ward skin for 13,540 RP (roughly $100).\n
        You can buy individual Signature Edition skins for the five champions as well, which might be a bit of a better deal if you don’t play the other champions as much. Those individual Signature Edition skins cost 2,530 RP (roughly $22) and include the champion, the T1 Worlds skin, the skin’s Elite Chroma, and a profile icon of the individual pro.\n
        Plenty of supporters may simply buy the Signature Edition of the T1 Orianna skin since it’ll also come with the profile icon for the greatest player in League‘s history, Faker. The 28-year-old legend has built up his own stalwart fan base over his career and is even considered to be one of the most popular figures in esports.\n
        Along with these new skins, Jayce is getting a special T1 Prestige skin that transforms him into a gilded version of himself. Not only is he representing T1 on Summoner’s Rift, but he’s also wearing a gold and white suit with a custom border and icon to boot. It’s a pretty rare skin and should be one that many T1 fans will be aiming for.

        It’s been an exciting start to the Counter-Strike 2 season. NAVI kicked off with a win in Riyadh at the Esports World Cup, while the rest of the top 10 battled through the BLAST Fall Groups. Many a team saw roster changes during the off-season, some of which—including Team Liquid—have already left quite an impression.\n
        The road to the Shanghai Major shortened by the day, but IEM Cologne saw its top teams all but certainly lock in a spot in their region’s qualifier for the pinnacle event. Here’s everything you need to know about IEM Cologne 2024’s results.\n
        IEM Cologne was one of CS2‘s premier tournaments for 2024 featuring a whopping 24 teams, three stages, and a million-dollar prize. Winners also secured a spot at Katowice 2025, the BLAST Premier World Final, and an Intel Grand Slam mark.\n
        Eight teams started the event in the group stage, while the remaining 16 battled through the Play-In double elimination bracket. Win two best-of-threes, and the team heads to the group stage; lose two, and they are out.\n
       The group stage saw the eight Play-In teams join the group stage invites and play another double-elimination bracket. The upper bracket winner headed to the semifinals; the upper bracket runner-up and the loser bracket winner both began their playoff runs in the quarterfinals.
      From there, the remaining six battled through a single-elimination playoff bracket to the trophy in the Cathedral of Counter-Strike itself, the Lanxess Arena.

        fullDesc: `After another unsuccessful year in a new region, VALORANT star Jaccob “yay” Whiteaker is hunting for a new team to call home after losing his starting position on Bleed Esports.\n
        The organization announced it would be restructuring a majority of its VALORANT roster, and as a result, four of the five players on the starting roster have been removed and will become restricted free agents for 2025. Along with yay, Deryeon, Retla, and Zest are now RFAs, meaning they’ll also need to find a new team for next year.\n
        When yay was announced as the newest member of Bleed at the end of 2023, fans were excited to see how the superstar would fare among fresh competition while also leaving behind the “financial drama” he faced in North America. Since then, however, El Diablo has only seen more difficulties on and off-stage.\n
        Yay kicked off his stint with Bleed Esports by going on a horrendous loss streak, before finally winning a series against DetonatioN FocusMe. Besides that victory, the team’s performance left a lot to be desired across 2024, finishing with only two series wins across the entire competitive year.\n
        It was a disappointing end to a new beginning for yay, who also dealt with drama when he was accused of bribing his coach on DSG to bench former teammate Genghsta. Although these allegations were never completely confirmed, they provided another sizable dip for yay’s roller coaster of a career thus far.\n
        Ultimately, yay will remain on Bleed’s inactive roster until another team comes along who is willing to take a chance on him again. Granted, yay has always shown flashes of his former greatness on stage, but he will need a ton of support if he decides to return to NA or try his luck in another region.

        fullDesc: `German Counter-Strike content creator ohnePixel is throwing his hat into the ring for the Perfect World Shanghai Major this September, with the streamer planning to “coach” a new squad that will aim to qualify for the pinnacle CS2 tournament.\n
        The 26-year-old streamer has listed himself as the coach for a new CS2 team on Aug. 12, led by former Monte captain Volodymyr “⁠Woro2k⁠” Veletniuk. Woro2k was benched by Monte after a two-year stint that included a historic playoff run at the BLAST Paris Major in 2022 as well as several smaller tournament wins. The in-game leader is yet to find a new home, but in the interim, he’s agreed to lead ohnePixel’s new project.\n
        Joining Woro2k is fellow Ukrainian Vladyslav “Kvem” Korol, French-Morrocan star Ali “⁠hAdji⁠” Haïnouss, and Israeli duo Tal “⁠meztal⁠” Hahiashvili and Meytar “⁠AMSALEM⁠” Amsalem. The majority of the squad hails from and plays in Europe, but thanks to hAdji’s dual nationality, they’ll be able to compete in the Middle Eastern qualifier.\n
        Winning in the MENA event would get the squad to the Asia-Pacific RMR, arguably the “weakest” of the regional qualifiers for the CS2 Shanghai Major—but their road to China will be far from easy, with many pundits calling this year’s APAC qualifier one of the toughest there is. Three spots are up for grabs, but with the likes of The MongolZ, FlyQuest, TYLOO, and more vying for a spot in the region’s first “home” Major, ohnePixel’s squad isn’t a sure bet to go all the way.\n
        It’s highly unlikely ohnePixel will actually stand behind the players when it comes to crunch time, though nothing’s confirmed there yet. Either way, his presence has certainly elevated interest in the squad thanks to his popularity in the CS2 community. Expect to see many tune in to the qualifiers to catch the squad as they battle for a spot in the APAC RMR.\n
        The Middle Eastern open qualifier for the Shanghai Major APAC RMR commences in a little under two weeks, leaving little in the way of practice time for the team—but at least each player will have a totally decked-out inventory to compete with.

        fullDesc: `Every Pokémon TCG deck has a chance at greatness, but when you enter the Pokémon World Championships, pros know the deck choice can make or break your entire season.\n
       The 2023/2024 season has seen one of the healthiest metagames in Pokémon history, with just under a dozen decks reaching the top eight through the year. Heading into Worlds, there’s a chance for any deck to make top cut, but some are better than others. Pokémon TCG pro players have highlighted three decks they expect to do well at the World Championships in Honolulu, Hawaii, from Aug. 16 to 18—and what they plan to use.\n
       “From my NAIC experience, Gardevoir feels like the perfect deck for me to take into Worlds.” Rose Gregon, a U.K. TCG player heading to Hawaii, told Dot Esports. “With enough adaptation to the new top decks, Charizard and Regidrago, I’m confident Gardevoir can beat anything.”\n
       Gregson continued, saying they expected “Regidrago to be the most popular and dominant deck in Worlds” and that, heading into Worlds, they “expect a lot of good players to pick the deck up and have deep runs.”\n
       Adam Hawkins, another top TCG player based in the U.K., agreed with one of those three; he expects Charizard to dominate in Honolulu when crunch time rolls around.\n
       “I’m always undecided on what deck to play until just hours before a tournament, so have to take several,” Hawkins told Dot. “My main choice currently would be the Charizard/Pidgeot/Dusknoir deck. The deck is very consistent, and with the new Dusknoir evolution line, [it’s] very versatile, so it feels like the safest pick for the World Championships.”\n
       In short, Gardevoir ex, Charizard ex, and Regidraco Lost Box are the three decks that some Pokémon TCG pro players expect to see dominate. No one mentioned the highly popular Raging BoltOgerpon ex deck that even took NAIC 2024 Senior’s title, so we’ll need to wait until Aug. 18 to see whose prediction was correct.

        The first character to receive a new, MMORPG-inspired look will be Overwatch‘s Widowmaker, who will get a WoW’s Sylvanas Windrunner skin, Blizzard announced on X on Aug. 20. The skin looks almost identical to one of the Windrunner sisters in WoW. It’s purple, like in the fantasy universe (and conveniently the color of Widowmaker’s default skin), and she holds a bow. The only change is a sniper rifle, Widowmaker’s main tool, which Blizzard has remade in the WoW aesthetic. Although if you see it as an ambitious transmog for the Night Elf, it’s more than believable she could be using a gun.\n
        The release date and further information about the crossover remain unknown. It is launching “later in season 12,” but Blizzard is keeping the spicy details to itself, at least for now.\n
        With Sylvanas making her way to Overwatch 2, it’s safe to predict other characters from WoW could become skins for heroes. These could probably include Thrall, Anduin Wrynn, Jaina Proudmoore, Khadgar, or Magni Bronzebeard, just to name a few. We can easily imagine Lifeweaver as Anduin or Reinhardt reimagined as Thrall. The possibilities are truly endless given the astounding amount of both WoW and Overwatch characters.\n

        In an Aug. 14 post on X, 100 Thieves officially announced Anthony “Zikz” Gray has signed a contract extension with the VALORANT team, keeping him with the organization as the head coach until 2027. In a press release, the org said this is the “first of many steps for 100 Thieves to continue building championship-level rosters.”\n
        Zikz is one of the bright minds of the North American VAL scene, having been part of the Evil Geniuses roster that won VCT Champions in 2023. “Tony is a rarity in the esports space.” Joseph Jang, VP of Esports for 100T, said in the press release. “There are few individuals in the scene that can maintain a world-class form across different titles.”\n
        Although Champions 2024 is ongoing, the organization is wasting no time in building its program for the upcoming season. 100T fell short of expectations they had for themselves following a promising start to the season.\n
        While 100T won the Stage 1 playoffs, qualifying for Masters Shanghai, they failed to capitalize on their international experience and fell short in the Stage 2 playoffs. This meant 100T could not qualify for Champions 2024 after failing to reach the top three and not having enough championship points. “My first year as a VALORANT head coach was a valuable learning experience,” Zikz said in the press release.\n
        Zikz is considered one of the best North American coaches out there, having success across multiple titles. Before moving to VAL, Zikz saw success in League of Legends with Counter Logic Gaming, winning an LCS championship with the org and taking NA to their first Riot international final at MSI 2016.

        To permanently add Fortnite Festival tracks to your collection, the only way is to purchase them for 500 V-Bucks in the Shop. This is your surefire method to access a song at any time, regardless of the current rotation. If you don’t buy them, the only other way to play a free song again is to wait until it appears as a Featured track in an upcoming rotation.\n
        Given the Fortnite Festival song list isn’t overly extensive, there’s a good chance you’ll see songs reappear in the free rotation multiple times a week. You have to keep an eye on the list to not miss them!\n

        fullDesc: `We’re living in the age of the Soulslike, and Black Myth: Wukong is living proof. Gone are the days of mediocre action-RPGs that barely hold a candle to FromSoftware’s greats; developers are spitting out exceptional Soulslikes left and right, and now it’s Wukong’s turn to take center stage.\n
        Black Myth: Wukong is the first AAA-standard release from Chinese developer Game Science. It’s loud and dramatic from the get-go, with top-tier combat and more top-quality boss fights than I’ve ever seen in a Soulslike. But while it does lots of things right, it’s missing a few important elements of the formula, stopping it shy of achieving true greatness.\n
        If you came for the boss fights, you’re in the right place.\n
        I’ll get straight to the point: Black Myth: Wukong’s combat and boss fights are excellent. Shortly after finishing the opening section, you awaken in a patch of dirt with nothing but a staff and a health bar, and a few moments later, it’s time to start smashing skulls. While Wukong lacks the build diversity of Souls games and most Soulslikes, its combat is refined, tightly designed, and—best of all—fun. You can’t parry, but there’s a perfect dodge system that feels satisfying and responsive, although the slow-mo effect when you evade perfectly does throw me off occasionally by making me mistime my next dodge roll.\n
        Hitboxes feel pixel-perfect for the most part, and attacks are well-telegraphed, so when you die, it’s usually because you need to git gud. Importantly, there are tons of different enemy types (with a whole host of new enemies every chapter), so combat always feels fresh, and my god, the boss fights. They’re ruthlessly challenging, especially from chapter two onward, and there are so many—from field minibosses to full-scale battles with Yaoguai—gargantuan Chinese mythological monsters ranging from gorgeous to grotesque. You could transpose these boss fights into a FromSoftware game and probably wouldn’t know the difference, which is a glowing compliment to Game Science’s boss designers.\n
        So, if you love Souls games for their rigorously refined combat and bombastic bosses, you’re in for a treat. But if you love Souls games for their build diversity, replayability, and exploration, you’re out of luck. There’s little in the way of build customization, and your version of Sun Wukong probably plays almost identically to mine. There are passive skill trees, and you can occasionally choose which permanent stats to upgrade; just don’t expect anything close to the freedom of other mainstream Soulslikes. You’re playing one character with one moveset and a (somewhat customizable) handful of spells, and you should expect that to stay the same throughout most of your playthrough.\n
        Likewise, if you’re hoping for a wide, open world to explore with lots of shortcuts and branching paths, you’ll be disappointed. Black Myth: Wukong isn’t an open-world game and doesn’t pretend to be. Each chapter has its own distinct biome—think green forests, yellow deserts, and snowy peaks, with zero overlap. There are cutscene transitions between each chapter, but you can freely travel back to old areas whenever you want. And while the first chapter is mostly linear, I was very impressed by the openness of the second. \n
        Black Myth: Wukong doesn’t have an open world, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t worth exploring. The outdoor environments are jaw-droppingly beautiful, which is likely down to the power of the Unreal Engine, but hats off to Game Science for making it work so well. But while the world is stunning, the level design leaves a lot to be desired. There are a few important (and missable) things to find off the beaten path, like treasure chests, meditation spots, and plants to mix into stat-buffing potions, but good luck working out where you’re going.\n
        Wukong’s biomes are disappointingly homogenous, so aside from a few striking exceptions, every area within a chapter looks almost identical. You start in a green forest, and a few hours later, at the end of chapter one, you’re still in that same green forest. There are very few discernable landmarks, unlike in Souls games, where past and future areas are clearly telegraphed on the horizon. Chapter two is full of branching paths, though, and even a door that “doesn’t open from this side” (praise the Souls!), but the whole map looks so goddamn similar that backtracking for things you missed is an exercise in patience.\n
        The worst part is that there are invisible walls everywhere. It’s not uncommon to see a path that looks like it hides a secret, but nope, there’s an invisible wall blocking the way. There’s a strange design dissonance in having secrets tucked in unlikely places, but to find those places, you need to repeatedly bash your head against invisible walls until you find a spot that isn’t blocked off.\n

        fullDesc: `Hong Kong-based esports organisation TALON Esports has announced a partnership with gaming hardware brand Razer.
As part of the deal, Razer will provide TALON Esports with peripherals to support the brand’s teams across various titles.\n
TALON’s VALORANT and Counter-Strike 2 teams will benefit from the deal. Moreover, PSG TALON’s League of Legends and Rainbow 6 Siege teams have been included in the partnership.\n
The players competing for TALON will be provided with the Razer Viper V3 Pro wireless esports mouse and the Razer Huntsman V3 Pro line of analogue optical switch keyboards. The keyboard in question has been in the headlines recently due to the controversial Snap Tap feature that Razer created. Snap Tap gives players a significant advantage while counter-strafing in first-person shooter games, but has now been banned from CS2 and ESL competitions.\n
Razer is no strangers to deals within esports, having launched specific peripherals for different esports titles such as Fortnite and partnering with various esports organisations such as MAD Lions KOI, Sentinels and more. However, according to the release this partnership has a specific purpose for Razer as it will see TALON provide feedback to the peripherals brand on its newest products to improve further the equipment.\n
This summer has been a busy one for TALON in terms of partnerships as the esports organisation secured deals with technology corporation VISA, streetwear brand Certified Saudi Arabia, blockchain company Perion Labs and hardware brand ThundeRobot. These partnerships come at a crucial time as TALON Esports looks to qualify for the Perfect World Shanghai Major 2024 in CS2 and defend the Pacific Championship Series (PCS) title in League of Legends.\n
Sean Zhang, the CEO of TALON, spoke on the partnership: “Razer is renowned for its innovation and dedication to ensuring esports players are equipped with the best gear possible for the best performance on the highest stage is defined by such small margins and reaction times, we are confident that our players will be able to maintain top form with Razer’s cutting-edge gear.”

        fullDesc: `Korean esports organisation Gen.G have announced plans to create a new hub in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n
        The announcement came earlier this month during the Esports World Cup. This marks the fourth city Gen.G will be expanding to, following headquarters in Seoul, Shanghai, and Los Angeles. Aside from opening up a new office, Gen.G is looking to bring its expertise in education to the MENA region.\n
        Nicole Choi, MENA Partnership Lead at Gen.G, explained on broadcast during the EWC, the organisation’s plans in the Kingdom.\n
        “Our models are very different from country to country and, being new here, we want to know the locals better so we have been working with a lot of local partners like Stc, and international partners like LG UltraGear, and the Saudi Esports Federation to bring these courses alive.”\n
        Gen.G is known for offering various educational courses through the Gen.G Global Academy (GGA) programme. Aside from the traditional training courses to help gamers improve their gameplay, Gen.G also offers certification courses for coaches in collaboration with the Saudi Telecom Company and less game-focused jobs such as project management, marketing, and partnerships.\n
        Choi also revealed an upcoming course with the goal of helping aspiring entrepreneurs open up their esports teams, teaching them all the necessary knowledge to run and scale up their own organisation.\n
        ESI reached out to Gen.G Global Academy’s (GGA) President Wang Guan to learn more about the decision which led them to establish the organisation’s presence in the MENA region: “We see the next era of esports to be created here in the MENA region, with KSA as the epicenter. And we want to be part of building that next era of the industry.”\n
        Wang revealed Gen.G wants to establish training infrastructure for both online and offline settings, with the latter being conducted alongside local partners.\n
        Given the organisation’s increasing presence, ESI asked Wang whether Gen.G had plans to expand to the European region: “We would love to see if we can attract potential users and esports enthusiasts to our activities in MENA. We are happy to explore the opportunities in international programs covering Europe.”\n
        Earlier this year, Gen.G announced the opening of a new building for GGA near the company’s HQ in Seoul, South Korea, with lecture rooms, esports training centres, streaming rooms, scrimmage zones, and rest areas.\n
        On the competitive side, Gen.G recently won both VCT Masters: Shanghai and the Mid-Season Invitational in League of Legends. Aside from these two game titles, Gen.G has competitive teams across Rocket League, PUBG, PUBG Mobile, and NBA2k.\n
        Thanks to the combination of education and competitive excellence, Gen.G has also formed a strong portfolio of partners including global brands such as PUMA, Monster Energy, LG UltraGear, and car maker Hyundai, as well as institutional partners such as the University of Kentuchy.

        fullDesc: ` Russian Counter-Strike 2 squad PARAVISION has had its Shanghai Major disqualification thrown out after it was revealed the banned coach was, in fact, unbanned. The coach successfully appealed the ban, but this information wasn’t passed between the Esports Integrity Commission, Valve, and Major organizers Perfect World, which has led to a reversal.\n
        PARAVISION will suit up for the European RMR and attempt to qualify for the Shanghai Major after the team and coach Ivan “F_1N” Kochugov argued to Perfect World over the nature of the ban yesterday. Sources told HLTV that F_1N had actually appealed to have his ESIC ban and demerit points reduced earlier in 2024 and was successful, meaning he would be fine to participate in this year’s Shanghai Major.\n
        F_1N was spotted in a social media post from PARAVISION on Aug. 23 with organizers believing he had been involved in coaching the squad during their qualifier—an act banned under Valve’s CS2 Major rulebook for online events. Further investigation from Perfect World revealed he was already permanently banned by Valve due to his involvement with the coach bug exploit of 2020, leading to the decision to disqualify the team.\n
        However, it appears the coach’s ban appeal wasn’t passed on to relevant parties correctly, leading to Perfect World issuing the DQ. HLTV’s report originally mentioned ESIC had failed to indicate the results of the appeal with other organizers or Valve, but the commission responded to Dust2.us reporter Jeffrey “Mnmzzz” Moore today to set the story straight.\n
        In the response, ESIC said HLTV’s source had misrepresented the information and that, despite “timely clarification by ESIC, HLTV has misreported the facts and misled the CS2 community.” At the same time, ESIC did not publicly announce that F_1N’s ban had been adjusted, making him able to compete. “How would Perfect World be ‘aware of F_1N’s appeal to ESIC’s independent panel’ when you have not made anything about it public?” HLTV’s Danish “Nohte” Allana responded.\n
        Anger at ESIC’s lack of announcement regarding the adjusted ban comes fresh off the heels of a scathing Dust2.us report marking three years on from the start of ESIC’s match-fixing investigation in North America—during which time, the commission has been notably quiet on the matter.\n
        PARAVISION’s reinstatement to the RMR also means the cancelation of the remake qualifier between eliminated teams BLEED, Monte, and KOI, who have now had their Major dreams crushed twice in a week.\n
        At the end of the day, communication is key, and it appears there’s been a severe lack of it at the highest organizational level for some time. It’s far from what CS2 needs right now, with clarity around such topics necessary ahead of the revamped, open esports circuit coming in 2025.

        In what will go down as one of the most competitive finals in the history of the VALORANT Champions Tour, EDward Gaming brought the trophy home by winning the first Champions trophy for China and defeating the European representatives, Team Heretics, by a 3-2 scoreline, courtesy of a record-breaking performance. \n
        KangKang, the star sniper and duelist for EDward Gaming broke the existing player kill record (111) in any best-of-five VCT tournament in VALORANT history to power his team through the challenges Team Heretics put in their path by using his signature picks of Neon, Raze, and Jett. According to VLR.gg, KangKang averaged 22.2 eliminations in each match, a bombastic performance and presence that earned him the MVP award of VALORANT Champions 2024 as well.\n
       It wasn’t smooth sailing throughout for EDward Gaming: They lost the first map as TH’s Benjyfishy reminded the crowd of his evergreen Cypher plays and crisp aim. However, the Chinese representatives proved their mettle by equalizing the series on Sunset by dominating the map and ending it on a scoreline of 13-4. They carried the momentum to Lotus, and after a close map, they came up on top and went for the title on Bind.\n
        It was another close affair between the two teams, but Team Heretics were barely able to push the series to a decider after a 13-11 win. Despite being so close yet so far from victory on map four, EDward Gaming started strong on Abyss, only to lose the tempo in the midgame where Team Heretics looked to regain momentum and go for the final push. However, the Chinese squad ultimately rallied forth to win the final two rounds and crown themselves as the champions.\n
        “Last year at LA [VALORANT] Champions, I was there as an audience, and that moment gave me power. We worked day and night every day. Using that power and the teammates we get here,” said Muggle, coach for EDward Gaming, in the post-match interview.\n
        Interestingly, the only Taiwanese player in the Chinese team, S1Mon joined the team just a month ago and is already a VALORANT Champions trophy winner, marking a fairytale start to his professional career.\n
“We’re more than this, this is just the beginning,” KangKang said to his crying teammate after receiving the MVP award during the post-match interview. If we had to go by the example of Riot’s other title, League of Legends, and its international esports history, this could be the start of Asian teams dominating yet another esports through stellar international performances.

        One of the staple figures in the VALORANT esports scene, AverageJonas announced today that the Norwegian will quit streaming Riot’s shooter title on all platforms and making his way to Valve’s third-person MOBA shooter, Deadlock. \n
        “…When the Sova nerfs hit me pretty hard, it was pretty tough to stay motivated, and also, the nature of the game being a tactical FPS is that it kinda limits the theory crafting you can do, compared to a game like DOTA,” AverageJonas said while also citing health reasons explaining his reason to switch to another title in a recent video. “I think I realized if I wanna do this for many years, I gotta focus on what makes me happy,” he said. \n
        AverageJonas felt “unhappy” while streaming VALORANT, and the Norwegian said he tried streaming different games like Palworld and DOTA, which revitalized his spirit to stream games that made him happy, and he just wanted for the “next big game.”\n
        That’s when, a month ago, AverageJonas was invited to a private playtest by Valve to try out Deadlock and felt it brought back his passion. “The more I play this game [Deadlock], I realized that it kinda sums up everything I want in a game and that I want to make content in,” he said. “It feels like an endless depth in stuff that I can dive into, teach people, theory-craft and fun with it, and it reignited the feeling I had when I started streaming,” he further explained on why he is looking to move onto Deadlock as his primary game for streams in the future. \n
        “I’m pretty terrified because this is my career, and I’ve seen many streamers switch games before, and a lot of times, it doesn’t necessarily go that well,” AverageJonas said about taking this leap of faith. \n
        AverageJonas’s career trajectory saw him start out as a caster and analyst in early VALORANT tournaments such as First Strike Europe, then becoming a content creator and signing with Team Liquid. He’s mainly known for his out-of-the-box Sova lineups, where he amazed the community with his creativity, who will no doubt miss his insightful commentaries on Riot’s shooter. \n
        In the meantime, if you’re looking to get into Deadlock, here is our guide to choosing the best heroes and outclassing your opponents!

        fullDesc: `Countless VALORANT fans that have been waiting for the first VCT event in Canada, and now, the wait might be coming to an end, according to the latest leaked video allegedly from the esports team at Riot Games.\n
        In a newly leaked video, Riot Games’ Anna Donlon and Leo Faria discussed the next locations for VALORANT‘s 2025 competitive events, and Canadian fans are over the moon with the news. According to the leaked video, there will be a VALORANT Masters tournament held in Toronto, Canada next June, marking the first time a major VCT event will be held in the country.\n
        VALORANT Masters Toronto will apparently be the second international event of the year, with the first Masters tournament being held in Bangkok, Thailand. Afterward, the final stop for international play will be held in the shimmering City of Lights—Paris, France. Overall, this will be a massive year for fans around the world, and should be especially exciting for Canadians fans who will finally get to watch VCT action at home.\n
        This would be one of the few times that Riot Games has held a major esports event north of the border in NA for its various competitive games. There have only been a couple of Riot events hosted in Canada, including the 2016 LCS Summer Finals and 2017 LCS Spring Finals. Besides that, Riot has not held an event in the country, much to the chagrin of Canadian supporters.\n
This hunger for a Canadian-based event flared up when Riot announced that the 2022 League of Legends World Championship would have its semifinals in Toronto, only for Riot to make a last-minute decision to move the event to Atlanta. According to Riot, the change was made due to COVID-19 and its impact on “securing multi-entry visas to the U.S. within necessary timelines.”\n
Hopefully, there won’t be any hiccups in the process this time around, because if Riot brings one of the biggest international VALORANT events to Toronto, one of the most passionate fanbases in the region will be ready and waiting.

        With VALORANT Champions 2024 zooming toward its final series, players are eagerly awaiting the promised reveal of the game’s next agent. And a few leaks might have given some fans a glimpse into the future—including the name and role of the upcoming character.\n
        According to recent leaks, the new character will be a sentinel named Vyse. It’s a fitting name for an agent who supposedly has a lot to do with thorny vines, which could be a great way to entrap unsuspecting enemies as they push onto a site or choke point on a map. The agent is also expected to be a female, based on a new voice line where Jett refers to them as a she.\n
        Riot Games has confirmed that players will get a first look at the new agent during the VALORANT Champions 2024 finals weekend, which will be taking place from Friday, Aug. 23 to Sunday, Aug. 25. There have been plenty of little teasers, though, released over the last few months, including a hint in a player card featured in the latest battle pass.\n
If these leaks are accurate, Vyse will be the sixth sentinel added to VALORANT‘s expanding roster of agents. This release would also ensure that the sentinel role has an equal number of agents to choose from alongside initiators and controllers since the sentinel role has the least amount of characters to choose from at this time.\n
The last sentinel to join the game was Deadlock, a character who was considered to be broken upon release due to her ultimate ability since it snatched up any enemies in its area of effect and dragged them to their death. Players quickly realized, however, that the rest of her kit was weak when compared to other sentinels, causing her play rate to plummet.\n
This leaked agent could add a bit of spice to the sentinel role that Deadlock failed to bring, while also shaking up the meta for the foreseeable future in both competitive and solo queue play.

        Deft announced that he’s going to miss competitive League of Legends next year due to military service, but that doesn’t necessarily mean his professional career is over.\n
        On Aug. 26, a clip from Deft’s interview surfaced on social media, with one fan posting a translation on X that same day. In the video, Deft claims he’ll be focusing on his military service next year, but if he has a chance in the future, he would like to return to League.\n
        “It seems like I’m going to perform military service next year. If my skills don’t decline when I come back, and if any team contacts me, I can always be a player again. That’s what I think,” Deft said, according to AlpacaHunt’s translation.\n
        Deft is currently signed with KT Rolster, with whom he competed in the 2024 LCK Spring and Summer Splits. They saw decent results, allowing the squad to qualify for the 2024 LCK Regional Finals, where they’ll fight for one of two spots at Worlds 2024. If Deft and crew fail at their last chance tournament, the season will be over for the renowned AD carry.\n
        Deft already has a World Championship trophy under his belt. He and DRX entered the event as LCK’s fourth seed in 2022 and made a miracle run all the way to the final, where they defeated the favorites in the form of T1.\n
        Deft has been competing professionally since early 2013, and in his 11-year career, he’s represented organizations like EDward Gaming, Samsung Blue, Dplus KIA, and Hanwha Life. If his skills don’t deteriorate, and he still wants to keep playing, he shouldn’t have an issue finding a new team in 2026.

        After being such a strong top laner upon release, Phroxzon feels the witch between worlds is getting closer to being more of a mid lane champion than in the top lane. “Now that her wave clear and damage are more in line, she’s a little more mid skewed, which is desirable. We want her to be stronger in mid than top generally,” he said.\n
        What small adjustments Riot will make to Aurora in Patch 14.17 is unclear. In the micropatch, Aurora saw her passive AP ratio increase from 1.5 to 2. Her Q (Twofold Hex) cooldown changes reverted to their original state, and her Q2 damage to minions partially reverted from 75 to 60. Phroxzon confirmed visual changes to her Q and ultimate are in the works, which should aid in players’ frustration with the champion.\n
        Players can expect these Aurora changes to roll out when Patch 14.17 hits the live servers on Aug. 28.

        The 2024 LEC campaign is nearing its end, and League of Legends fans have already had enough of the LEC Season Finals, calling it a “snooze fest” as the season comes to a close.\n
        The LEC format featuring a three-split model followed by a Season Finals hasn’t been the most popular in the community. The format has limited the number of roadshows Riot Games is putting on for Europe, with only a single event at the end of the year and the other finals in the Riot Games Arena, Berlin. Having a condensed format followed by every final outside of the Season Finals played in the same 200-capacity studio has been a tough watch for fans.\n
        That tough watch led to fans expressing their frustrations about the LEC Season Finals on Reddit. The frustration comes from the fact that the six-team tournament only has two weekly games. “It’s hard to build momentum with two games a week,” the original author of the Reddit post said. “It doesn’t feel like it’s do or die.\n
        While only two more best-of-fives are getting played, the LCS Championship sees the upper and lower brackets play in the same week. This upcoming week, for example, fans will get to see all six teams compete, some twice in seven days, while Fnatic fans will have waited two weeks by the time they face MAD Lions KOI. “2 weeks to play 4 Bo5 really is peak snooze fest” another Reddit user said.\n
        One fan suggested combining the Season Finals with the Summer Split. The latter tournament is played shortly after the Summer Split finals have concluded, leaving little room for hype to build for either event and leaving the Summer Split in a weird place. “The way it works now kills all hype for summer playoffs, and it makes season finals feel tacked on,” one fan said.\n
        Although no changes to the format are coming immediately, the LEC Season Finals are underway. With G2 already qualifying for Worlds 2024, two spots are up for grabs between Fnatic, Mad Lions KOI, and BDS. The next match will see G2 Esports take on BDS on Aug. 23.`

        Dota 2‘s esports calendar is vast and all-encompassing, but by far the highlight of the year is The International, the largest celebration of the game we all know and love in the form of a huge tournament seeing squads from across the globe battle to destroy the other’s ancient.\n
        Esports fans from other titles always swing by a Dota 2 stream or two during TI, with the event historically one of the largest in terms of prize pool. However, things changed in 2023 after a landmark decision from Valve to cut back on crowdfunding the event via the battle pass.\n
        As a result, this year’s TI 2024 prize pool is lower than one would think. Here’s the prize pool for 2024’s edition of Dota 2‘s The International.\n
        The prize pool for TI 2024 is currently $2,315,148 USD according to the Dota 2 prizetac.kr tool, which tracks the total contribution made by players through the TI 2024 Compendium.\n
        Not all of this prize pool is crowdfunded, with Valve throwing in $1.6 million of its own money as per usual. Otherwise, 25 percent of the money paid by players who buy the Compendium and any other associated TI products in Dota will be added to the pool. As of Aug. 31, the community has contributed less than half the amount Valve has thrown in so far.\n
        This is a record low for the pinnacle event, which saw a switch-up to the approach of crowdfunding The International in 2023. With a plan to expand in-game content over the whole year as opposed to a single battle pass, it means the Compendium is targeted purely at fans of teams and players and doesn’t include your regular fare of cosmetic Dota 2 items.\n
        This has drawn plenty of criticism from both pro players and the community. With players choosing to spend on cosmetics via new events like Crownfall, there is less incentive for the wider community to contribute to the Compendium. As a result, 2023’s TI prize pool—a little above $3 million—was the smallest in over a decade.\n
        2024 looks destined to go even lower, with last year’s Compendium purchases well ahead of this year’s target at the same time. Barring additional items added to the Compendium or a discount weekend, TI 2024 is on track to have a prize pool less than even the Dota Majors of old.\n        
        We’ll keep this piece updated throughout TI 2024 with the most up-to-date numbers available!

       The past week in Dota 2 has been quite eventful. And it would’ve likely been an exciting one if all the events didn’t revolve around a single item—the Hand of Midas—that continues to be exploited. Now, a new bug involving the Lone Druid has been discovered.\n
       Though not as powerful as the initial couple of Midas exploits, the Lone Druid can now reset, or speed up, the recharge of Midas by utilizing the all-too-powerful Spirit Bear. If Druid casts the Hand of Midas on a creep, then gives it to the Spirit Bear with a full inventory and passes the Midas into another slot in the backpack, the item gains an extra charge that only the Spirit Bear can use. I’ve confirmed this exploit in a demo area, and it appears that after the extra charge is spent, there is no way of resetting the cooldown until it ticks down on its own.\n
       This is just one of many Hand of Midas exploits that, though not too powerful, essentially grants Lone Druid double uses for the price of one. The charge mechanic has also been rumored to be the culprit behind all the exploits. That’s still unconfirmed, but judging by Valve’s continuous 100MB or bigger updates to fix the damned item, it’s probably not some small thing going wrong in the back end.\n
       This week, we’ve seen the Hand of Midas being reset through drops and purchases, hand-downs between players, Arc Warden using all of the item’s charges on his team with his illusions, and Techies essentially casting Midas infinitely by moving it around his backpack. All of these exploits impacted matches to varying degrees, with some of them making heroes like the Ogre Magi quite popular for a couple of days due to his Multicast ultimate.\n
       The Lone Druid exploit is likely to be patched as soon as Valve catches wind of the circulating videos showcasing the bug, though it’s highly likely Dota 2 players will figure out some other way of exploiting the covetous Hand of Midas.

        fullDesc: `
     After Midas became the most popular item in Dota 2 overnight, Valve quickly swooped in to fix the exploit related to it. But it didn’t take long for players to figure out another exploit with the same result, which is using the Hand of Midas with no cooldown whatsoever.\n
     Yesterday, Valve suddenly issued a 140 MB patch with no notes or announcement, which seems to have aimed to fix some bugs in the game, among them the Hand of Midas cooldown exploit. While it previously required Dota 2 players to use Midas, then drop it on the ground, purchase another from quick buy, and then sell it to refresh the dropped item’s cooldown, there’s now a different way to achieve the same result. If two players purchase the Hand of Midas, use it, and then swap it between each other, one of them will get two full charges of the item reset instantly, allowing the exploit to continue flourishing.\n
     As shared by Dota Cinema and discussed by many Dota 2 players on the game’s subreddit, the Hand of Midas exploit is still alive and well, though it does take some extra steps to pull off. I’ve gone into a custom match and spawned a bot with Midas equipped and can confirm that this approach to the exploit does indeed work. But it’s inconsistent and sometimes takes swapping Midas between heroes several times until the cooldown is finally refreshed.\n
     Since the exploit was discovered, Ogre Magi‘s pick rate jumped from 15 to 23 percent, according to stats site DotaBuff, because the hero can use his Multicast ability on the item to farm hundreds of gold in a single click. Based on how frequently the exploit has appeared in my matches, I advise players to avoid ranked matchmaking at least for another few days until Valve finally irons out the Hand of Midas and its charge functionality, which seems to be the cause of this game-breaking bug that so many players are taking advantage of.

        Over the history of Counter-Strike, fans have created several new gameplay modes, but this one could be the most exciting so far—it lets you play a game of soccer.\n
        It’s not specifically soccer, to be precise, but futsal, an indoor version of the sport. A player named vstmn created a new mode for CS2 that lets you hop onto the field and kick the ball around with your friends. Reddit user mrbattery shared a video showcasing the mode to Reddit on Aug. 27, and fans are overjoyed. We’d love to see the new mode played competitively.\n
Players pick one of two teams: Red or Blue. Then, players dictate the rules of the game from a variety of options. Players can choose the ball size, allow or disallow guns (which can change the trajectory of the ball), allow the ball to be picked up, and more. Additionally, players can set up a music playlist to play in the background, and customize their teams’ logos.\n
The mod released on the Steam Workshop on July 20, but it was updated on Aug. 27. At the time of writing, it has 1,234 subscribers, meaning lots of players have downloaded it to try it out for themselves. We’d be lying if we said we’re surprised; despite it being a fan-made mode, the gameplay looks smooth and dynamic, and we’re already gathering friends to play with us.\n
So far, the mode has amassed a whole host of positive reactions. “Looks really cool! I already tried it with a few friends, and it’s a very well-designed and fun map,” one player wrote on Reddit. There are a few minor issues, but they aren’t gamebreaking, according to players. “The only issue is, once the ball hits the wall of the field, it’s hard to get it back into the field. So the ball often just rolls along the fence,” another player added.\n
Since the mod has already seen a few updates, we hope the creator continues to nurture it so that it becomes even more popular in the community.

        PGL announced its Counter-Strike 2 tournament schedule on Aug. 27, but it apparently lacks open qualifiers, which is dividing the community.\n
        After the schedule was announced on PGL’s X account (formerly Twitter), Complexity’s CS2 general manager Graham Pitt reposted it with additional information. According to Pitt, there won’t be open qualifiers for any of the PGL events “due to a very busy event schedule.” The tweet landed on Reddit shortly after, where players discussed the adjustment in an Aug. 27 thread. Some fans believe it goes against the way the open circuit is supposed to be, while others aren’t surprised at all.\n
        With the lack of open qualifiers, the teams invited to PGL’s invited will likely be chosen based on Valve’s rankings. The majority of the points in these rankings will be allocated depending on teams’ results in tournaments, including PGL’s circuit. Some fans fear the scene will remain stale as a result.\n
        “It basically makes it impossible to qualify to any of the big events as a small t2 team. You’d have to completely dominate the region for an extended period of time and have one of the t1 teams bomb out in last place multiple times in order to get invited,” another fan added.\n
        Others believe having open qualifiers for each tournament would consume too much time and effort to be affordable. They also think the best tier two teams will have to grind to make their way into tier one to earn invites. “The whole CS circuit will be your open qualifier. Work your way up to tier 1 and fight for your ranking,” one fan wrote.\n
        Pitt seconded the opinion. “Firstly, not criticizing PGL for this. The calendar is crazy next year and running quals would be a nightmare task. Secondly, the key change obviously is that all invites are done on merit next year. That’s great,” he wrote. However, he thinks the scene will continue “to have the same teams playing events when they’re all so invite heavy.”\n
        From 2025 onward, CS2 will have no partnership leagues, with organizers forced by Valve to switch to a ranking-based circuit. While seeing PGL resign from open qualifiers may be worrying for tier two and three teams, there are still plenty of other organizers in the scene who might have a different approach to their events.

        NiKo will reportedly bid farewell to G2 Esports in the upcoming months, with the player having sealed the deal with another popular organization in Counter-Strike 2.\n
        Renowned esports journalist and insider Alejandro Gomis reported on X on Aug. 26 that the Bosnian CS2 star is set to join Team Falcons following a one to 1.2 million dollar buyout. According to Gomis, the move won’t take place before the Perfect World Shanghai Major 2024, scheduled to begin by the end of November, meaning the reported move would likely occur in December.\n
        NiKo has been at G2 for four years, joining the team in November 2020. Since then, he’s led the roster to numerous trophies, including IEM Katowice and IEM Cologne.\n
        G2 have unfortunately been unable to grasp a Major title, finishing second at the PGL Major Stockholm 2021, but the Bosnian will have one more shot at leading the squad to Major glory this Fall in China—if they qualify.\n
        Before joining G2, NiKo represented FaZe Clan and MOUZ. In that time, he became one of the most profound and skilled riflers in CS:GO and his prowess hasn’t dropped since CS2 launched last September.\n
Falcons, on the other hand, are urgently looking for ways to improve their horrible year. The organization assembled a superstar roster by the end of 2023 with the likes of SunPayus and maden, but has yet to win a meaningful trophy in CS2. Acquiring Niko, one of the world’s best players, is bound to elevate their chances, at least theoretically.

        The Fnatic ONIC Philippines and Smart Omega match-up on Saturday was a notable event since it marked the first time Duanne “Kelra” Pillas and Joshua “Ch4knu” Mangilog faced each other on opposing sides of the arena.\n
        Last season, the opportunity for a direct clash never arose.\n
Ch4knu had been transferred from the MDL to MPL late in the season to help his team, Smart Omega, secure a spot in the playoffs. As a result, Kelra and Ch4knu did not meet in a head-to-head match.\n
In the post-match interview, Kelra expressed his excitement leading up to the game and reflected on the challenge of facing Ch4knu. Despite the sweep, he found the match-up particularly difficult.\n
        “Excited ako sa laban namin ngayon. Dito talaga ako pinakana-excite noong nakalaban ko na si Ch4knu. First time ko lang din siya nakalaban. Last season hindi ko na siya nakalaban,” said the 19-year-old gold laner.\n
        “Parang ang hirap niya talaga kalaban. Yung mga ginagawa namin dati noong magkasama pa kami sa may marksman, ganon ginagawa niya sa akin ngayon eh. Medyo nahirapan ako. Kaya sobrang excited ako sa magiging laban namin, kung ano ipapakita niya, kung ano yung ipapakita ko.”\n
        Smart Omega was hailed as one of the strongest teams this season due to their dominance in the early weeks. Kelra pointed out that Ch4knu’s maturity, both in and out of the game, has been a crucial factor in his former team’s improvement.\n
        “Tingin ko, pinakaunang nabago niya is yung outside the game na ugali. Ayon siguro yung pinaka-key para gumanda pa yung performance niya. Kasi yung mga nakaraang season na magkasama kami parang nagiging inconsistent yung performance niya. Ngayon kasi nakikita ko parang bumabalik yung dati niyang laro noong kasama ko pa siya,” he said.\n
        “Kumbaga parang narinig ko din sa Omega na parang bagong panganak na si Ch4knu na sobrang mabait siya, maaga siyang gumising, tapos parang captain na captain na talaga. Kaya sobrang natutuwa ako na ganon na siya ngayon. Sobrang mature na.”

        After a four-season absence from the MPL Philippines, Gerald “Dlar” Trinchera has made a triumphant return.\n
The 24-year-old exp laner, known for his dominance since joining the league in Season 4 through to Season 9, has long been a formidable presence in his role.\n
Dlar earned the nickname “The General” for his brilliance on the exp lane, playing a pivotal role in helping Onic Philippines secure runner-up finishes three times.\n
However, his comeback to the MPL Philippines has not been without challenges.\n
“Tingin ko sobrang hirap manalo ngayon at makipagsabayan kasi sobrang dami na nilang knowledge. Ta’s na-feel ko sa sarili ko na sobrang dami ko pang hahabulin talaga,” Dlar admitted in an exclusive interview.\n
Despite the struggles early in MPL Philippines Season 14, Dlar is thrilled to be back home after his stints in Indonesia and Myanmar.\n
“Dati may mga dinudurog ako, may mga sinasabayan ako. Pero ngayon parang yung mga katapat dito sa MPL PH siyempre mas malakas na sa’kin. Nandun ako sa sobrang saya na nandito pa rin yung competitiveness ko tapos mas malakas yung kalaban ko,” he said.\n
“Naramdaman ko ngayon sobrang gigil ko at sobrang saya na dumidikit pa pala ako sa mga mas batak sa akin.”\n
As one of the high-profile players in Blacklist, Dlar has faced significant bashing and criticism, especially with the team starting the season with a 0-4 record. Nevertheless, he remains unaffected by the negativity.\n
“Motivation ko na sila. Normal naman sa mga esports players na may basher. Kino-convert ko lang yun in a positive way,” he said of his critics.\n
“Thank you rin sa inyo (bashers) dahil nagga=grind lalo ako. Kasi may mga times na napapa-isip ako na parang gusto ko na rin magpahinga or retire, pero dahil sa mga basher lalo ako ginaganahan. Pati sa mga nagtitiwala rin sa akin kaya nagpapatuloy pa rin ako.”

        Falcons AP.Bren outlasted RSG Philippines in a thrilling three-game series, 2-1, during MPL Philippines Season 14 on Friday at the Green Sun Hotel in Makati.\n
The decisive Game 3 saw the reigning world champions rely on the lethal Lolita-Hanabi combo, expertly executed by Rowgien “Owgen” Unigo and Marco “Super Marco” Requitiano.\n
This strategy proved to be a significant challenge for the Raiders, who struggled to secure a win despite their strong early-game performance.\n
Super Marco finished the match with a flawless record of four kills and five assists, while Owgen contributed one kill, ten assists, and two deaths.\n
“Medyo sobrang saya naman din namin kase nanalo kami ngayon kase mahirap din magka-points ngayon. Kulang pa rin kami sa practice ngayon, sa tingin ko, kailangan pa rin namin talaga pag-igihan para makuha namin yung spot sa M6,” Falcons AP.Bren coach Robert “Trebor” Sanchez remarked, reflecting on the hard-fought victory.\n
Game 1 was a showcase of team effort for the reigning world champions, with Michael “KyleTzy” Sayson (Nolan) and Marco “Super Marco” Requitiano (Harith) being given free rein in every team fight.\n
Their flawless execution was made possible by the solid support from their teammates.\n
Falcons AP.Bren dominated the Raiders, limiting them to just one kill in the entire 14-minute game.\n
KyleTzy and Super Marco finished the match without a single death, amassing a combined five kills and eight assists in the 8-1 kill score.\n
However, Game 2 saw RSG Philippines mount a strong comeback. Jhondy “Nibor” Ranque (Edith) led his team in each team fight, helping them tie the series 1-1.\n
Nibor’s presence in every skirmish was crucial, leading to a perfect performance with two kills and 10 assists in the 12-3 kill score of Game 2.\n
Looking ahead, Falcons AP.Bren will face Team Liquid Philippines on Saturday at 7:30 p.m., while RSG Philippines will aim for their second win against Blacklist International on the same day at 5:00 p.m. Both matches will take place at the same venue.
